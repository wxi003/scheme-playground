# scheme-playground
Practice and explore Racjet programming with code snippets, projects, and notes.

## /practices
Pure functional implementation from scratch, that does not employ advanced functions or imperative features. Therefore, besides basic arithmetic operations and number comparisons, you are allowed to use only the following basic Scheme functional constructs: 
1. function creation: lambda
2. binding: define, let, let*, letrec
3. booleans: not, and, or
4. conditionals: if, cond
5. list operations: car, cdr, cons, list, append, null?, member – comparison: eq?, eqv?, equal?
6. mapping: map, apply

### Files
- binding.rkt: Examples of binding
- partition.rkt: Implements a function, (partition pred lst), that divides a list lst into two sublists, according to the predicate pred.
